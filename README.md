# CMOS-LOGIC-Y-AB-CD-E-

**OBJECTIVE**

To design and implement a CMOS logic circuit based on the Boolean expression:

ùëå=(AB+CD+E)'
‚Äã
 
Construct the circuit using NMOS and PMOS transistors as per CMOS design principles.

Capture the schematic using Virtuoso Schematic Editor.

Perform functional simulation using Cadence Spectre simulator.

Verify the output response for all combinations of the input variables.

Ensure proper logic operation and validate the Boolean function implementation.
