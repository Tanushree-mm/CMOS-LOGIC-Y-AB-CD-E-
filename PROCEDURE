#### **Step 1: Create New Library**

* Open Cadence Virtuoso.
* Go to: `File → New → Library`
* Give it a name (e.g., `Lab3_CMOS_Logic`)
* Attach to technology: `gpdk180`

---

#### **Step 2: Create New Cell View**

* In Library Manager: `File → New → Cell View`
* Cell name: `Boolean_CMOS`
* Tool: `Virtuoso Schematic Editor`
* View Name: `schematic`

---

#### **Step 3: Instantiate Devices**

* Go to `Create → Instance`
* Use the following from `gpdk180` library:

  * NMOS: `Width = 6 µm`, `Length = 180 nm`
  * PMOS: `Width = 8.85 µm`, `Length = 180 nm`
* Arrange transistors according to the Boolean expression:

  * Build **pull-down network** for `AB + CD + E`

    * Series NMOS for `A` and `B`, `C` and `D`; all in parallel with `E`
  * Build **pull-up network** as dual of pull-down

    * Parallel PMOS for `A` and `B`, `C` and `D`; all in series with `E`
* Add `VDD`, `GND`, inputs `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E` and output `Y`.

---

#### **Step 4: Check & Save**

* Go to `Design → Check and Save` to ensure no connection errors.

---

#### **Step 5: Create Symbol**

* From schematic: `Create → Cellview → From Cellview`
* Define pin placement.
* Customize symbol if needed.

---

#### **Step 6: Create Testbench**

* New Cell View: e.g., `Boolean_CMOS_tb`
* Instantiate symbol from previous step.
* Add:

  * `vpulse` or `vpwl` sources for inputs `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`
  * Load capacitor at output (e.g., 100 fF)
  * `VDD = 1.8V` and `GND`

---

#### **Step 7: Setup Inputs**

* Voltage Sources:

  * A: Pulse, Period = 160 ns, Pulse Width = 80 ns
  * B: Pulse, Period = 80 ns, Pulse Width = 40 ns
  * C: Pulse, Period = 40 ns, Pulse Width = 20 ns
  * D: Pulse, Period = 20 ns, Pulse Width = 10 ns
  * E: Pulse, Period = 10 ns, Pulse Width = 5 ns

---

#### **Step 8: Launch ADE L**

* From testbench: `Launch → ADE L`

---

#### **Step 9: Simulation Setup**

* Choose **Simulator**: Spectre
* Add Model Libraries (`gpdk180.scs`)
* Setup **Transient Analysis**:

  * `Analysis → Choose → Transient`
  * Stop time: \~200 ns

---

#### **Step 10: Select Outputs**

* `Outputs → Setup → From Design`
* Select `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `Y` to plot

---

#### **Step 11: Run Simulation**

* `Simulation → Netlist and Run`
* Observe logic behavior of the expression.
